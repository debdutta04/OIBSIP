        <h2>Early life and education</h2>
        <h3>Family</h3>
        <p>
            Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, 
            to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah "John" Jandali .
            Jandali was born in a Muslim household to wealthy Syrian parents, the youngest of nine siblings.
            After obtaining his undergraduate degree at the American University of Beirut,
            Jandali pursued a PhD in political science at the University of Wisconsin. There, he met Joanne Schieble,
            an American Catholic of German descent whose parents owned a mink farm and real estate.
            The two fell in love but faced opposition from Schieble's father due to Jandali's Muslim faith. 
            When Schieble became pregnant, she arranged for a closed adoption, and travelled to San Francisco to give birth.

        <h3>College</h3>
        <p>
            In September 1972, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland,
            He insisted on applying only to Reed, although it was an expensive school that Paul and Clara could ill afford.
            Jobs soon befriended Robert Friedland,[37] who was Reed's student body president at that time. Brennan 
            remained involved with Jobs while he was at Reed. He later asked her to come and live with him in a house he
            rented near the Reed campus, but she refused.
            After just one semester, Jobs dropped out of Reed College without telling his parents.
            Jobs later explained this was because he did not want to spend his parents' money on an education that seemed meaningless to him.
            He continued to attend by auditing his classes,[39] including a course on calligraphy that was taught by Robert Palladino. 
            In a 2005 commencement speech at Stanford University, Jobs stated that during this period, he slept on the floor in friends' dorm rooms,
            returned Coke bottles for food money, and got weekly free meals at the local Hare Krishna temple. In that same speech, 
            Jobs said: "If I had never dropped in on that single calligraphy course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts"

        <h2>Apple (1976–1985)</h2>
        <p>
            By early 1985, the Macintosh's failure to defeat the IBM PC became clear,and it strengthened Sculley's position in the company. 
            In May 1985, Sculley—encouraged by Arthur Rock—decided to reorganize Apple, and proposed a plan to the board that would remove Jobs from the Macintosh group and put him in charge of "New Product Development".
            This move would effectively render Jobs powerless within Apple. In response, Jobs then developed a plan to get rid of Sculley and take over Apple.
            However, Jobs was confronted after the plan was leaked, and he said that he would leave Apple. The Board declined his resignation and asked him to reconsider.
            Sculley also told Jobs that he had all of the votes needed to go ahead with the reorganization. A few months later, on September 17, 1985, Jobs submitted a letter of resignation to the Apple Board. 
            Five additional senior Apple employees also resigned and joined Jobs in his new venture, NeXT.
            The Macintosh's struggle continued after Jobs left Apple. Though marketed and received in fanfare, the expensive Macintosh was hard to sell.
            In 1985, Bill Gates's then-developing company, Microsoft, threatened to stop developing Mac applications unless it was granted "a license for the Mac operating system software. Microsoft was developing its graphical
            user interface ... for DOS, which it was calling Windows and didn't want Apple to sue over the similarities between the Windows GUI and the Mac interface.
            Sculley granted Microsoft the license which later led to problems for Apple. In addition, cheap IBM PC clones that ran Microsoft software and had a graphical user interface began to appear. Although the Macintosh preceded the clones,
            it was far more expensive, so "through the late 1980s, the Windows user interface was getting better and better and was thus taking increasingly more share from Apple".
            Windows-based IBM-PC clones also led to the development of additional GUIs such as IBM's TopView or Digital Research's GEM, and thus "the graphical user interface was beginning to be taken for granted, undermining the most apparent advantage of
            the Mac...it seemed clear as the 1980s wound down that Apple couldn't go it alone indefinitely against the whole IBM-clone market"
